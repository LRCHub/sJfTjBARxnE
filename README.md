[00:14.88] Right now, I'm in Thailand
[00:16.97] Quarantined, it's a foreign scene
[00:18.90] Can't go to the airport and leave
[00:20.61] And I thought my old life was boring, geez
[00:41.61] 
[00:22.40] 'Scuse me, I'm 'bout to bang my forehead on the floor and scream
[00:25.22] The dude I'm staying with's annoying
[00:26.79] How much fucking torture can boredom be?
[00:28.36] Take my ass to the morgue in peace (look bitch)
[00:51.86] 
[00:30.12] It's 2020, I was preparing some new bombs
[00:31.83] And making sure that my competition gon' put that noose on
[00:34.25] My aggression ain't really a subtle nuance
[00:35.60] I been in the game ten years, I cannot do wrong
[00:59.10] 
[00:37.71] Who's on what I'm on? I'm savage as usual
[00:39.34] I'm back in the booth, I have rappers to poop on
[00:41.50] Now there just ain't many plans I can move on
[00:43.34] All because someone ate bat soup in Wuhan (what?)
[01:07.84] 
[00:45.52] Well shit, that's what I heard
[00:47.27] I don't know what it was mixed with (I don't know)
[00:48.81] But for someone to jeopardize everyone's life
[00:50.63] Man, it must have been fucking delicious (for real)
[01:16.13] 
[00:52.72] This shit is fucking ridiculous
[00:54.03] Can't be with my son or my siblings, the government trippin'
[00:56.31] My pussy appointments with dozens of bitches are cancelled
[00:58.64] Now guess what I'm tuggin' my dick with? (What?)
[01:22.64] 
[01:00.38] "My right hand", ooh
[01:01.40] When I get a tingle inside of my penis, I'm like, "Hi, my friend"
[01:04.08] And you know the lotion is sitting on, "My nightstand"
[01:05.78] And when I finish my business, I go to "Night-night Land"
[01:07.56] And now I gotta take a weapon gettin' groceries
[01:09.34] Hopefully motherfuckers know to back away forty feet
[01:11.19] Don't be jokingly mingling if you happen to notice me
[01:13.04] I ain't fuckin' with none of you niggas 'til the 'Rona leave (ugh)
[01:46.04] 
[01:15.42] Get back (hey)
[01:16.30] Move back, step back
[01:17.45] Y'all better not touch me, ay
[01:19.22] Get back (come on)
[01:20.02] Move back, step back
[01:21.34] Y'all better not touch me (ugh)
[01:36.84] 
[01:22.68] I done been tellin' y'all niggas, back up (move)
[01:25.04] You don't wanna see me call back up (no)
[01:26.68] So get back (hey)
[01:27.64] Move back, step back
[01:28.84] Y'all better not touch me
[01:41.34] 
[01:30.19] We all at home, we campin' out (fuck this)
[01:31.89] I notice everybody made a TikTok, oh, we dancin' now
[01:34.45] And I see about four, five
[01:36.14] 600 new hoes made a OnlyFans account
[01:38.21] Get your money girl
[01:39.33] Better get your dough (yeah, flash them titties one time)
[01:42.06] This ain't funny girl
[01:43.25] You finna be broke (you don't wanna be a broke bitch)
[02:09.75] 
[01:45.15] Somebody told me it was the 5G towers
[01:47.00] And everybody's immunity is spiraling downwards
[01:49.06] And if it's true, fight the power, the time is now
[01:51.10] I gotta divide the crowd from the mindless cowards
[01:52.99] I know y'all love when I recite some foul words
[01:55.16] Especially during the COVID-19 outburst
[01:57.08] And I got nothing better to do
[01:58.07] Evidence proves, I been spending hours live on IG, wowzers
[02:27.07] 
[02:00.52] Wait, hold up, wait, that's strange
[02:02.22] I sent a text, why you ignoring me? (You ignoring me)
[02:04.37] Hmm, I know you got time to reply
[02:05.96] Bitch, don't even lie, 'cause you in the quarantine
[02:31.46] 
[02:08.14] Yeah, I know how you do (yeah)
[02:09.36] You with your boo (yeah)
[02:10.11] You treatin' my feelings so morbidly
[02:11.67] After this song drop, bitch, I'm blocking you
[02:13.49] Don't be surprised when your text isn't going green (ha!)
[02:41.99] 
[02:16.06] How do we deal with a worldwide corruption?
[02:17.95] I don't know if the media is hyping up shit
[02:19.64] Look at the situation our life is stuck in
[02:21.64] I got no toilet paper to wipe my butt with (ugh)
[02:23.30] Whoever did this is on Hopsin's shit list
[02:25.28] God forbid, the world gets apocalyptic
[02:26.95] Well it is soon, look at all the odds against it
[02:29.19] So don't touch me without my permission (ugh)
[02:51.69] 
[02:30.93] Get back (hey)
[02:31.88] Move back, step back
[02:33.11] Y'all better not touch me, ay
[02:34.87] Get back (come on)
[02:35.76] Move back, step back
[02:37.16] Y'all better not touch me (ugh)
